### Problem:
Addition (or multiplication) of numbers <br>
The input is a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. Using long arithmetic
program: <br>
a) sum of integers <br>
b) product of integers <br>
c) sum of real numbers <br>
d) product of real numbers <br>

It is not possible to make assumptions about the length of the input files, therefore it is necessary to use dynamic data structures (dynamically allocated array, linked list, tree)

### Solution

#### Usage CLI:

args: program_name input_name.txt {sum,prod}

example:

./a.out input.txt sum -> sum of numbers
./a.out input.txt prod -> product of numbers
